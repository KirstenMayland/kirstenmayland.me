            <h3> Hi! I'm Kirsten </h3>
            <p> I'm currently a Computer Science Major ('25) at Dartmouth College up in NH. Dartmouth was my first introduction to
                CS, so while I love it, I'm still discovering what applications interest me the most. Right now, I love
                anything with a healthy bit of problem solving and an end goal that feels worth it, which is one of the reasons why 
                I'm very interested in working for DALI. </p>
