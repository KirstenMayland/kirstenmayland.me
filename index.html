                    <p> I'm currently a Computer Science Major ('25) at Dartmouth College up in NH. Dartmouth was my first introduction to
                        CS, so while I love it, I'm still discovering what applications interest me the most. Right now, I love
                        anything with a healthy bit of problem solving and an end goal that feels worth it, which is one of the reasons why 
                        I'm very interested in working for DALI. </p>
                    <p> This website was my first introduction to html/css/javascript, and I’ve really enjoyed teaching myself and 
                        exploring the world of frontend development which I previously didn’t have any experience with. 
                        Most of my effort was poured first into figuring out how to create a working navbar and then creating the 
                        “Orienteering” page, between the banner that goes under the navbar, the grouping of the text and image, 
                        and the slideshow. Oh, and figuring out how to keep the website’s integrity when it was resized. 
                        It’s been a really fun challenge! </p>
